                    It didn't hit me until then how much the iPhone has evolved over the last 10 years. The tiny screen. The fuzzy pixels. The camera that couldn't even shoot video. A measly eight gigabytes of memory. It didn't even seem like it came from the same company as the iPhone X.
The iPhone X feels like the perfect device to celebrate Apple's tenth anniversary of the iPhone, a representation of how far tech can go in a decade. I've had the iPhone X, which went on sale last Friday, for a week. It's the best smartphone I've ever used, and represents a new direction in how Apple views the iPhone.
